EC2 = a virtual computer (server) you rent on AWS


Types of Ec2 :

- General purpose t3: Balanced compute, memory, and networking for most everyday workloads.

= Compute-optimized c5: High CPU performance for compute-intensive tasks.

= Memory-optimized r6: Large, fast memory for processing big datasets in RAM.

= Accelerated computing g4: Specialized hardware (GPU/accelerators) for graphics, ML, and complex calculations.

= Storage-optimized i3: High-performance local storage for data-intensive workloads.


T → Typical (general use)

C → Compute

R → RAM

G → GPU

I → IO / storage

note : Shared responsibilty(EC2)
The customer is responsible for configuring, 
securing, and managing the operating system, networking, 
and applications on their EC2 instances.

While AWS is responsible for Software for storage, compute, database and network including 
necessary harware.


Quick guide to  EC2 instance  initalization : 
 
 choose number of instance you want to create 

 Choose AMI : An AMI is a template that defines what software and OS an EC2 instance launches with.

Choose server type : According to purpose e.g. general purpose t3

Firewall 

Storage 
 
advance settings

launch

Multi tendency : 
Multiple users sharing the same EC2 instance while maintaining isolation
