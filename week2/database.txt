RDS (Relational Database Service) :
- Managed service that makes it easy to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud.
- Automates time-consuming administration tasks like hardware provisioning, database setup, patching, and backups.

Supported Database Engines :
1. Amazon Aurora (AWS proprietary, high performance)
2. PostgreSQL
3. MySQL
4. MariaDB
5. Oracle
6. Microsoft SQL Server

Key Features :
- Multi-AZ Deployments : Synchronous replication to a standby instance in a different Availability Zone.
  - Primary use case: Disaster Recovery (DR) and High Availability.
  - Automatic failover if the primary instance goes down.
- Read Replicas : Asynchronous replication to read-only instances.
  - Primary use case: Improved performance for read-heavy workloads.
  - Can be promoted to a standalone database.
- Automated Backups : Point-in-time recovery (retention 1-35 days).

Amazon Aurora :
- Fully managed, MySQL and PostgreSQL-compatible relational database built for the cloud.
- Up to 5x faster than standard MySQL and 3x faster than standard PostgreSQL.
- Storage auto-scales automatically.
- Aurora Serverless : Automatically starts up, shuts down, and scales capacity based on application demand.


Aurora provides comparable performance to high-end commercial databases but at "one-tenth" 
the cost, which makes it ideal for organizations looking to 
reduce database costs without sacrificing performance.

Non-SQL (NoSQL) Databases :
- Databases optimized for specific data models (key-value, document, graph) rather than tabular relations.
- Flexible schema, high scalability, and performance.

Amazon DynamoDB :
- Fast and flexible NoSQL database service for any scale.
- Key-value and document data models.
- Serverless : No servers to provision or manage.
- Performance : Single-digit millisecond latency at any scale.
- Capacity Modes :
  - On-Demand : Pay-per-request (best for unpredictable traffic).
  - Provisioned : Specify RCU (Read Capacity Units) and WCU (Write Capacity Units) (best for predictable traffic).
- DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) : Fully managed, in-memory cache for DynamoDB (improves performance from milliseconds to microseconds).
- Global Tables : Replicates data automatically across your choice of AWS Regions.

AWS Database Migration Service (DMS) :
- Helps migrate databases to AWS quickly and securely.
- The source database remains fully operational during the migration, minimizing downtime.
- Supports homogeneous migrations (e.g., Oracle to Oracle) and heterogeneous migrations (e.g., Oracle to Amazon Aurora).
- Can be used for continuous data replication with high availability.
- AWS Schema Conversion Tool (SCT) : Used in conjunction with DMS for heterogeneous migrations to automatically convert the database schema and code objects.

Other AWS NoSQL Services :
- Amazon ElastiCache : In-memory data store (Redis or Memcached) for caching to improve app performance.
- Amazon DocumentDB : Fully managed document database (MongoDB compatible).
Amazon DocumentDB excels at handling semistructured data like product catalogs.
- Amazon Neptune : Fully managed graph database.
Neptune provides low-latency and high-throughput performance for both read and write operations, 
making it suitable for real-time applications working with connected data.

AWS Backup :
- A fully managed service to centralize and automate data protection across AWS services.
- Helps meet regulatory compliance and business continuity goals.

Key Features :
- Centralized Management : Manage backups for multiple AWS services (EBS, RDS, DynamoDB, S3, EFS, FSx, etc.) from a single console.
- Policy-Based : Create backup plans (frequency, retention period) and assign resources to them.
- Cross-Region / Cross-Account : Copy backups to other regions or accounts for disaster recovery.
- Lifecycle Management : Automatically transition backups to cold storage (cheaper) or expire them.
- Vault Lock : Prevents deletion of backups (WORM - Write Once Read Many) for compliance.
