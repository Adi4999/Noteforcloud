Amazon VPC is a solid box, and it represents your isolated, logically segmented network within AWS.
 A VPC helps you to control your network resources and security.


The NAT (Network Address Translation) Gateway or NAT Instance plays a very specific role in a VPC:
 allowing private subnet resources to access the internet without exposing them directly.


Subnets :
- A range of IP addresses in your VPC.
- Public Subnet: Has a route to the Internet Gateway (IGW). Resources here can access the internet.
- Private Subnet: Does not have a direct route to the IGW. Resources here cannot be directly accessed from the internet.

AWS Direct Connect :
- A dedicated physical network connection from your on-premises data center to AWS.
- Bypasses the public internet.
- Benefits: Consistent network performance, lower latency, increased bandwidth, and potential cost savings on data transfer.

AWS VPN services :
- AWS Site-to-Site VPN : Securely connects your on-premises network or branch office to your VPC over the public internet using IPsec.
- AWS Client VPN : Securely connects individual users (remote workers) to AWS or on-premises networks.

AWS Global Accelerator :
- A networking service that improves the availability and performance of your applications for global users.
- Uses the AWS global network infrastructure (instead of the public internet).
- Provides two static IP addresses that act as a fixed entry point to your application.

Security Groups vs Network ACLs (Firewalls) :

+---------------------+---------------------------+----------------------------+
| Feature             | Security Group            | Network ACL (NACL)         |
+---------------------+---------------------------+----------------------------+
| Level of protection | Instance level (EC2)      | Subnet level               |
| Stateful/Stateless  | Stateful (Return traffic  | Stateless (Return traffic  |
|                     | allowed automatically)    | must be explicitly allowed)|
| Rules               | Allow rules only          | Allow and Deny rules       |
| Evaluation          | All rules evaluated       | Processed in number order  |

Amazon CloudFront (CDN) :
- A Content Delivery Network (CDN) service that delivers data, videos, applications, and APIs to customers globally with low latency and high transfer speeds.
- Caches content at Edge Locations (servers closer to users).
- Protects against DDoS attacks (integrated with AWS Shield).

Amazon Route 53 :
- Highly available and scalable Domain Name System (DNS) web service.
- Translates human-readable domain names (www.example.com) into IP addresses.
- Key Features:
  1. Domain Registration.
  2. DNS Routing (Simple, Weighted, Latency, Failover, Geolocation).
  3. Health Checks (monitors app health and routes traffic away from unhealthy endpoints).
  4. You can buy and manage domain names directly in Route 53.
