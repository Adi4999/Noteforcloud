Fully managed : AWS handles all infrastructure, patching, and scaling. You focus on code. (e.g., Lambda, S3)
Managed : AWS handles hardware and OS; you handle configuration and tuning. (e.g., RDS)
Unmanaged : You manage the OS, patching, and scaling. AWS provides the hardware. (e.g., EC2)

AWS Lambda : Serverless compute service. Run code without provisioning servers,
its an event based service which means only initiates and run when a particular event is triggered.
- Event-driven
- Pay only for compute time
- Auto-scaling


How to set up Lambda function :
1. Go to AWS Console > Lambda > Create function.
2. Select "Author from scratch".
3. Enter Function name.
4. Choose Runtime (e.g., Python, Node.js, Java).
5. Configure Permissions (Execution Role) to access other AWS services.
6. Click "Create function", add code, and Deploy.

Shared Responsibility (Serverless) :
AWS : Manages infrastructure, OS, runtime, and system maintenance.
Customer : Manages code, data encryption, and IAM permissions.


Containers and orchestration :
Containers : Package code and dependencies together. Ensures consistency across environments.
- Docker is the standard tool for creating containers.

Orchestration : Managing the lifecycle of containers (deploying, scaling, networking).

AWS Container Services :
1. Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service) : AWS-native orchestration tool. Simple, integrates deeply with AWS services.
2. Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) : Managed Kubernetes service. Open-source standard.
3. AWS Fargate : Serverless compute engine for containers.
   - Works with ECS and EKS.
   - No EC2 management required (pay for vCPU/RAM used).

Elastic Container Registry (ECR) : Fully managed Docker container registry.
- Store, manage, and deploy container images.
- Integrated with ECS, EKS, and Lambda.
- Secure (IAM integration) and highly available.

AWS Elastic Beanstalk : Platform as a Service (PaaS).
- Automates deployment: You upload code -> AWS handles capacity provisioning, load balancing, scaling, and health monitoring.
- Best for: Developers who want to deploy apps quickly without managing infrastructure details.
- Control: Keeps control over underlying resources (e.g., EC2).
- Pricing: Free service (pay only for underlying resources like EC2/RDS).
