Scaling and elasticity : When you need to upgrade your service due to growing demand, 
either you scale horizontally or vertically.

Scaling : Scalability describes the capability to increase capacity
elasticity : how quickly and automatically resources change based on demand. 

vertically  by upgrading to a larger EC2 instance

horizontally by adding more instances using services like *Auto Scaling.

*Auto Scaling : Featue by AWS, to increase or decrease instances according to the load on server.



summary (exam-ready)
Concept	What it means
Scalability	: Ability to grow capacity
Vertical	: One way to scale (bigger instance)
Horizontal	: One way to scale (more instances)
Elasticity	: Automatic scaling based on demand


load balancer : It distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers 
to improve availability, fault tolerance, and performance. AWS has ELB (Elastic load balance)

ELB (load balancer) : It automatically distributes incoming traffic across multiple AWS resources such as
EC2 instances, containers, and IP addresses.

Simple Queuing servie (SQS) and Simple Notification Service (SNS) :
 SQS Purpose:
Decouple components by sending messages to a queue, 
where messages are processed by one consumer at a time. (makes components loosly coupled)

SNS Purpose:
Send messages to multiple subscribers at the same time.


SQS + SNS Together (Fan-out pattern ⭐)

SNS sends a message to multiple SQS queues,
each queue processes the message independently.

This is a very common AWS architecture.

One-line exam tip ⭐

SQS = store and process messages
SNS = broadcast messages

Key Differences: SQS vs SNS

+--------------------+-------------------------+---------------------------+
| Feature            | SQS (Queuing)           | SNS (Messaging)           |
+--------------------+-------------------------+---------------------------+
| Pattern            | Point-to-point Queue    | Publish / Subscribe       |
| Message delivery   | Pull-based              | Push-based                |
| Consumers          | One consumer per message| Multiple subscribers      |
| Processing         | Asynchronous            | Event-driven              |
| Message retention  | Yes (configurable)      | No (temporary delivery)   |
