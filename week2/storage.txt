Types of storage : 

Block : Data divided into blocks, direct access without file system layers,
best for apps/db that require fast updates 

Object : consists of data,unique id and metadata. Requires full rewrite while updating Object.
organised using buckets. best for large/ infrequently changed files.

File storage : Cloud based access via shared files. Strightforward implementation without code changes
Best for apps needing share file access.


EC2 instance store is directly attached to the host, offering extremely low latency and
 high I/O performance for applications that need temporary storage with fast access.


EBS (Elastic Block Store) : Persistent block storage volumes for EC2 instances.
- Network-attached and replicated within an Availability Zone.
- Data persists independently of the instance's life.

EBS snapshots : Point-in-time backups of EBS volumes.
- Stored incrementally in Amazon S3.
- Used for disaster recovery or creating new volumes.

Amazon Data Lifecycle Manager : Automates the creation, retention, and deletion of 
EBS snapshots and AMIs based on defined schedules/policies.


Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) : Scalable object storage service.
- Stores data as objects in buckets (containers).
- 11 9s of durability (99.999999999%).
- Unlimited storage, pay for what you use.
- Regional service, but bucket names are globally unique.
- Storage classes available for different access patterns (Standard, Glacier, etc.).

Amazon S3 Security :
- Encryption:
  - Server-Side Encryption (SSE): AWS encrypts data at rest (SSE-S3, SSE-KMS, SSE-C).
  - Client-Side Encryption: You encrypt data before uploading.
  - In-transit: Data is encrypted via SSL/TLS (HTTPS).
- Access Control:
  - IAM Policies: User-based permissions (who can access what).
  - Bucket Policies: Resource-based permissions (who can access this specific bucket).
  - Block Public Access: Prevents public access to buckets/objects.
- Versioning: Keeps multiple variants of an object (protects against overwrites/deletes).


S3 Storage Classes :
- S3 Standard : General purpose, high availability, for frequently accessed data.
- S3 Intelligent-Tiering : Automatically moves data between access tiers based on usage patterns (cost optimization).
- S3 Standard-IA (Infrequent Access) : Lower storage cost for data accessed less often, but requires rapid access.
- S3 One Zone-IA : Stores data in a single Availability Zone (lower cost, lower durability against AZ failure).
- S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval : Archive storage with milliseconds retrieval.
- S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval : Low-cost archive, retrieval times from minutes to hours.
- S3 Glacier Deep Archive : Lowest cost storage, retrieval times of 12-48 hours.

S3 Lifecycle Policies :
- Automate moving objects between storage classes or deleting them to save costs.
- Transition Actions: Move objects to cheaper storage (e.g., Standard -> Glacier) after a set time.
- Expiration Actions: Automatically delete objects after a specific period (e.g., delete logs after 90 days).

Amazon EFS (Elastic File System) :
- Fully managed NFS (Network File System) for use with AWS Cloud services and on-premises resources.
- Can be mounted on multiple EC2 instances across multiple Availability Zones simultaneously.
- Highly available, durable, and automatically scales storage capacity up or down as you add or remove files.
- Compatible with Linux-based AMIs (POSIX compliant).
