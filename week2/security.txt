Authentication and authorization : 

Authentication (AuthN) : Verifying identity ("Who are you?")
Authorization (AuthZ) : Verifying permissions ("What can you do?")

AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) :
- Global service (not regional).
- Manages access to AWS services and resources securely.
- Free to use.

IAM Components :
1. IAM User : Represents a person or application. Has long-term credentials.
2. IAM Group : A collection of users. Permissions assigned to a group apply to all users in it.
3. IAM Role : An identity with specific permissions that can be assumed by users or AWS services.
   - Uses temporary security credentials.
   - Example: An EC2 instance using a role to access S3.
4. IAM Policy : A JSON document that defines permissions (Allow or Deny actions).

IAM Best Practices (Exam Important) :
- Lock away the root user access keys (don't use root for daily tasks).
- Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all users.
- Principle of Least Privilege : Grant only the permissions needed, nothing more.
- Use Roles for applications running on EC2 (never store credentials on the instance).

AWS Cognito :
- Provides authentication, authorization, and user management for web/mobile apps.
- User Pools : Directory for users (sign-up/sign-in).
- Identity Pools : Vends temporary AWS credentials to users to access resources.

AWS Shield :
- Managed Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) protection service.
- Shield Standard : Free, automatically enabled for all AWS customers. Protects against common layer 3/4 attacks.
- Shield Advanced : Paid service. Provides additional protection for higher-level attacks,
  24/7 access to DDoS Response Team (DRT), and cost protection against spikes due to DDoS.

AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall) :
- Protects web applications from common web exploits (SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting).
- Works at Layer 7 (Application Layer).
- You define rules (Access Control Lists - ACLs) to allow or block traffic.
- Can be attached to CloudFront, Application Load Balancer, API Gateway.

Amazon Inspector :
- Automated security assessment service.
- Scans EC2 instances for software vulnerabilities and unintended network exposure.
- Produces a report with findings prioritized by severity.

Amazon GuardDuty :
- Intelligent threat detection service.
- Uses Machine Learning to analyze AWS logs (CloudTrail, VPC Flow Logs, DNS Logs) for malicious activity.
- Example: Detects if an EC2 instance is communicating with a known malicious IP or mining cryptocurrency.

Amazon Macie :
- Fully managed data security and privacy service.
- Uses Machine Learning to discover and protect sensitive data (PII - Personally Identifiable Information) in Amazon S3.

AWS Artifact :
- Central resource for compliance-related information.
- Provides on-demand access to AWS security and compliance reports (ISO, PCI, SOC reports).
- Used to prove to auditors that AWS is compliant.

AWS KMS (Key Management Service) :
- Managed service to create and control encryption keys.
- Used to encrypt data at rest across many AWS services (EBS, S3, RDS, etc.).
- Integrated with CloudTrail to log key usage.

AWS Detective :
- Simplifies the investigation process for security findings.
- Automatically collects log data from AWS resources (VPC Flow Logs, CloudTrail, GuardDuty).
- Uses machine learning, statistical analysis, and graph theory to build "visualizations".
- Helps identify the root cause of potential security issues.

AWS Security Hub :
- Centralized security dashboard.
- Aggregates alerts (findings) from various AWS services (GuardDuty, Inspector, Macie, IAM Access Analyzer) and partner tools.
- Performs automated compliance checks against standards (CIS, PCI DSS).
- Provides a comprehensive view of your security posture across AWS accounts.
