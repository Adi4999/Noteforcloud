Example: node app 

app->dockerfile-> docker build -t image-name . -> image built -> run the image in form of a container

-build your node server project. After you development, make a docker file (named Dockerfile)



-for eg
------
FROM node:20 (base image, ':20' represenets the version of node,optional)

WORKDIR /app (working directory withing node image)

COPY package*.json  ./ (cache reasons)


RUN npm install (to install all the dependencies of the project)


COPY . .  (copy all other files first dot represenets path of desired files, all files, 
second dot represenets taget location of working directory in the base image)


EXPOSE 3000 (to run project on the port 3000)

CMD ['node','server.js']
------

- terminal : docker build -t node-app .  (image will be built with the name node-app, and 
'.' denotes the current directory for the docker file)


- to verify the image build, in terminal : docker images

output :
                                                                                                               i Info →   U  In Use
IMAGE                         ID             DISK USAGE   CONTENT SIZE   EXTRA

node-app:latest            975889dbd06f       1.63GB          407MB    U



- running a docker image (into a container)
docker run -d --rm --name "node-server-app" -it -p 3000:3000 node-app bash (running docker container in detached mode )


note :
run         Create and run a new container from an image
exec        Execute a command in a running container
